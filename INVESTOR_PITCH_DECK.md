## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

### Businesses are drowning in repetitive work

**60% of employee time** spent on tasks that could be automated:
- Customer support
- Data entry
- Scheduling
- Email responses
- Report generation

**Result:**
- ❌ High labor costs (€50-100k per employee/year)
- ❌ Slow response times (hours/days vs minutes)
- ❌ Human errors (5-10% error rate)
- ❌ Limited availability (40 hours/week vs 168 hours/week)
- ❌ Scaling is expensive (linear cost growth)

**Market Pain:**
- SMBs can't afford large teams
- Enterprises waste millions on inefficiency
- Current solutions are fragmented (need 10+ tools)
